# Horae

Setup an end to end example project for JFrog Platform Deployment leveraging the JFrog free trial.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need to have a fresh instance of JFrog Platform whether it is commercial or a [free trial](https://jfrog.com/platform/free-trial/)


### Installing

#### 1.0 Configure Integrations under "Pipelines"
You'll need to create 3 Pipelines integrations - [see documentation](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Configuring+Pipelines#ConfiguringPipelines-add-integrationAddingAdministrationIntegrations) in order to setup JFrog Pipelines to work with your Artifactory & Distribution services, as well as pull the Pipelines sample code from GitHub. 

##### 1.1 Github 
   1.1.1 In order to create a GitHub integration, you need the generate a GitHub Personal Access token first.
   As also stated in the documentation instructions below, generate a Github Personal Access Token with the 
   following permissions:
    
    * repo (all)
    * admin:repo_hook (read, write)
    * admin:public_key (read, write)
   
   An example token would look like that  `2f3ed30dec7537a56064436cbedacc00813d247d`
    
   1.1.2 Create a Pipelines integration of type GitHub named "**GitHub**" and provide connection details generated according to the [documentation](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/GitHub+Integration).

  
#####  1.2 Artifactory
   In order to create an Artifactory integration, we recommend that you'll generate an API Key following these [instructions]( https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/User+Profile#UserProfile-APIKey]).
   
   Create a Pipelines integration of type Artifactory named "**Artifactory**" and provide the details for your Artifactory access (URL, admin user and password/apikey).
   
   As an example:
    
    URL - https://myserver.domain.com/artifactory
    Admin user - myname@domain.com
    Password/APIKey - AKCp8hyPw7CP3GuGCxqThixEJCjjuY26v1BotRtVctcdcgudsn7JDMBvHBYfDCMyGD6Htu65Y'

##### 1.3 Distribution
###### Only for Enterprise+ subsription (not to perform on the free tier)
   Create a Pipelines integration of type Distribution named "**Distribution**" and provide connection details to your Distribution endpoint.
    
   As an example:
   
    URL - https://myserver.domain.com/distribution
    Admin user - myname@domain.com
    Password/APIKey - AKCp8hyPw7CP3GuGCxqThixEJCjjuY26v1BotRtVctcdcgudsn7JDMBvHBYfDCMyGD6Htu65Y
  
 > **Note that the integration names must match the source name in the yaml configuration and are case-sensitive**

 
#### 2.0 Configure Pipeline Sources
2.1 Fork the following two (2) repositories:
  
  * https://github.com/shimib/horae
  * https://github.com/shimib/project-examples (Make sure you fork the following branch: eplus-v2-orbitera or simply "all branches")
  
2.2 Next we'll need to modify some of the configuration in the forked code:

2.2.1 Go to horae/pipelines/base_init.yml and modify the following values based on your github path.

> horae/pipelines/base_init.yml:  
```
resources:  
  - name: demo_gitRepo  
    type: GitRepo  
    configuration:  
      path: [your_Github_username]/horae  <<<--- CHANGE HERE
      gitProvider: GitHub  
  - name: gitRepo_code  
    type: GitRepo  
    configuration:  
      path: [your_Github_username]/project-examples  <<<--- CHANGE HERE 
      gitProvider: GitHub  CHANGE 
      branches:  
        include: eplus-v2-orbitera  
```  
2.3 Add your forked repository (forked from **shimib/horae**) as a pipelines source.
You can follow the instructions [here](https://www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/JFROG/Managing+Pipeline+Sources#ManagingPipelineSources-AddingaPipelineSource(SingleBranch)) on how to add a **"Single-branch"** source

> Note: 
    
    > Enterprise+ Trial: Use -- 
        Pipeline Config File Filter : pipelines/.*\.yml
  

### 3.0 Deployment

You're all set now, and ready to initialize your environment and run your first Pipelines!

#### 4.0 Run Pipelines

  4.1. Run the init pipeline 1st which should: Create users, groups, permissions, repositories, Xray policies & watches, update Xray indexes and setup Access Federation.

  4.3. Run the npm_build pipeline
  
  4.4. (The distribution pipeline should be triggered automatically)
